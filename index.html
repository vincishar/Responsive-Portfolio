<p>
I graduated from the University at Buffalo with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology 
with a minor in International Business.<br> Since then I have worked one dead end job to 
another, so I've been bouncing around until I've found a stable career. <br>I learned about coding
through a workforce event and took an online course on udemy about the basics of web developlment.<br>
I've grown a high interest in coding and decided to pursue coding bootcamps and 
the one I'm enrolled in Columbia happened to be an option on the site.
